# Home Lab 2.0

## Objective

My homelab needed improvements.  I needed more control and the ability to easily add and expand to the network using Vulnhub. 

### Skills Learned

- pfSense Network Segmentation & Security.
- Security Onion as an all-in-one IDS, Monitoring and Log Management.
- Windows Server as Domain Controller setup.
- Configuring Splunk/Elastic/Graylog.
- Ability to add Ubuntu/Metasploitable/Vulnhub machines.

### Tools Used

- pfSense
- Splunk <-- Expired trial.
- Elastic  <-- Splunk replacement.
- Security Onion
- Kali/Parrot OS
- Windows 2019 Server
- Ubuntu 23.10

## Steps

Full write up still in progress.  I miss a couple of important screenshots when deploying the environment. 
I will re-deploy a whole new lab soon and make sure to get proper documentation setup.
